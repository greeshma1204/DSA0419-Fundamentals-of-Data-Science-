import numpy as np

# Sample fuel efficiency data (miles per gallon) for different car models
fuel_efficiency = np.array([25, 30, 35, 40, 32])  # Each element represents a car's fuel efficiency

# Step 1: Calculate the average fuel efficiency
average_efficiency = np.mean(fuel_efficiency)

# Step 2: Select two car models for comparison (e.g., first and last models)
model1_efficiency = fuel_efficiency[0]  # Fuel efficiency of the first car model
model2_efficiency = fuel_efficiency[-1]  # Fuel efficiency of the last car model

# Step 3: Calculate the percentage improvement in fuel efficiency
percentage_improvement = ((model2_efficiency - model1_efficiency) / model1_efficiency) * 100

# Output the results
print(f"Average fuel efficiency: {average_efficiency:.2f} miles per gallon")
print(f"Percentage improvement in fuel efficiency from model 1 to model 2: {percentage_improvement:.2f}%")
